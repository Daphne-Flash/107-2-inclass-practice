## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
x3 <- c("小明","小花")
y3 <- c("小明","小華")
```

```{r}
x3 != y3
x3 == y3
```

```{r}
!( x3 == y3)
x3 == y3
```

```{r}
library(readr)
exData2 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpemartin/github-data/master/exData2.csv")
currency <- exData2$"幣別"
```
```{r}
head(currency)
```

```{r}
class(currency)
```


```{r}
currency <- as.factor(currency)
class(currency)
```

```{r}
levels(currency)
```
```{r}
length(levels(currency))
```
```{r}
step1_extractLevelsVector <- levels(currency)
step1_extractLevelsVector

```
```{r}
step2_countVectorLenrth <-
  length(step1_extractLevelsVector)
step2_countVectorLenrth
```

```{r}
head(currency)
```

```{r}
sum(currency == "日圓JPY/USD")
```
